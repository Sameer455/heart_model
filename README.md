Heart Disease Prediction App 🚑❤️
This is a Heart Disease Prediction App built with Python and Streamlit. The app uses a Random Forest Classifier trained on a heart disease dataset to predict the likelihood of heart disease based on user-provided health parameters.

Features 🩺
Interactive Interface: Users can input their health details using an intuitive UI.
Machine Learning Model: Utilizes a trained Random Forest Classifier for predictions.
Real-Time Results: Provides immediate feedback on whether the individual is likely to have heart disease.
Accuracy Report: Displays the accuracy of the trained model during runtime.
Dataset 📊
The application is trained on the Heart Disease Dataset (ensure to replace this link if you're using a different source). The dataset includes features like age, cholesterol levels, chest pain type, and more, which are used for prediction.
